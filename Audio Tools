There are many different audio tools available that will allow you to record and edit any audio you wish.
The one i would personally recommend is Audacity, a software that is free to download and that i used for my digital systems class.
This program gives you the tools to not only record and edit audio, but also create audio from virtually nothing.
I would highly recommend downloading Audacity and messing around with it before being asked to create something with it, as there are many different features available.
